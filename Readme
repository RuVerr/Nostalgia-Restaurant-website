# Nostalgia Restaurant Website

This is a real website project for the **Nostalgia Restaurant**.

In this project, I was given full creative freedom, and the task was to make the website **beautiful and user-friendly**. I developed everything from scratch, strictly following **SOLID principles**.

All the code was written in **vanilla JavaScript**, without using any external libraries. I manually implemented page translations and repeatedly adjusted the HTML structure to find the best solutions.

The **design and layout** of the website were created entirely by me. I personally handled:

- Structuring HTML multiple times for better solutions
- Implementing functionality through classes and constructors
- Designing the website interface and user experience
- Following SOLID principles throughout the JavaScript code

I organized all files and classes thoughtfully to ensure that the code remains **clear, maintainable, and understandable**, even years later.

I really enjoyed this project, especially because many developers forget about using classes in JavaScript. My goal was to structure everything clearly and move towards an **ideal result** step by step.
